    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to analyze **hidden correlations** between two related tables (**Batting** and **Fielding**) that are not directly linked but share common attributes. We followed a structured approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Explored correlations in real data** by merging Batting and Fielding through the **Players** table and computing a correlation matrix.\n",
    "2. **Trained a synthetic data generator** using the original tables while ensuring dependencies were properly modeled.\n",
    "3. **Generated synthetic data** with the same set of players to maintain consistency.\n",
    "4. **Merged synthetic Batting and Fielding tables** and analyzed their correlation matrix.\n",
    "5. **Compared real and synthetic correlations** to assess how well the generator preserved hidden relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaways**\n",
    "- The **Players table** acts as a bridge, allowing correlations between Batting and Fielding to emerge naturally.\n",
    "- Training the generator with **both Batting and Fielding tables together** helps maintain these correlations.\n",
    "- The **side-by-side comparison** of correlation matrices allows us to measure how well the synthetic data preserves relationships found in the original dataset.\n",
    "- Synthetic data can successfully retain complex dependencies, making it useful for **privacy-preserving data analysis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Next Steps**\n",
    "- **Validate correlations statistically**: Beyond visual analysis, we can quantify correlation differences using metrics such as **mean absolute correlation difference (MACD)**.\n",
    "- **Apply to other domains**: The same methodology can be applied to financial data, healthcare records, or customer behavior analysis to ensure synthetic data maintains key statistical properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this process, we can ensure that synthetic data is **both privacy-safe and statistically valuable**, unlocking new possibilities for AI-driven data exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "🚀 **Now it's your turn!** Try modifying the dataset or generator settings to see how correlations change and adapt to different data structures.  \n"
